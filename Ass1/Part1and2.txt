Part 1:
My favorite app is probably snapchat.
What makes this my favorite app is that It is basically a messenging app, but with video and photos. Also its cool to see a small slice of someones life.

In terms of PU, the app can help a company from a marketing standpoint, but as far as the individual goes, it will hinder someones job performance instead of helping it.
In terms of PEOU, i'd say the ease of the application is easy for someone who is familiar with social media apps, but maybe difficult for someone who isn't used to those types of apps. Once the layout is known though, it makes for a very smooth experience.
